# ELIG_INVALID_VISA_OR_INSUFFICIENT_TERM (D912)

## Description
The application is declined if the applicant’s visa subclass is not supported or if there is insufficient time remaining on the visa.

This rule relies on **verified** visa attributes (subclass + expiry), not a visa identifier.

---

## Inputs
- visa_subclass: string (e.g., "485", "600", "771")
- visa_expiry_date: date (ISO format)
- assessment_date: date (defaults to today)

Derived:
- months_remaining_on_visa = months_between(assessment_date, visa_expiry_date)

---

## Policy Config
unsupported_visa_subclasses:
- "601"
- "651"
- "771"
- "600"
- "462"
- "417"
- "590"
- "870"
- "400"
- "785"
- "790"
- "030"
- "040"
- "041"
- "050"
- "051"
- "942"
- "988"
- "602"

minimum_months_remaining: 12

---

## Evaluation Logic
unsupported = visa_subclass in unsupported_visa_subclasses
insufficient_term = months_remaining_on_visa < minimum_months_remaining

---

## Threshold
unsupported == false  
AND  
insufficient_term == false

---

## Outcome
- PASS: visa_subclass is supported AND months_remaining_on_visa >= 12
- FAIL: visa_subclass unsupported OR months_remaining_on_visa < 12

---

## Typical Remediation
- Reapply once visa status changes to a supported subclass
- Reapply when sufficient time remains on the visa

---

## Notes
- The list of subclasses is treated as **policy configuration**, not code
- This rule is deterministic and versioned
- Visa verification is assumed to be handled upstream and only verified facts are consumed here
